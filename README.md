This project is based on the ideas in Phil Hine’s *Prime Chaos*, focusing on the philosophy, practice, and history of Discordianism.  
Our aim is to introduce, translate, and develop these concepts in Japanese.

- **Quaesitor Stick** (*Prime Chaos*)
- **Discordianism** (*Prime Chaos*)
- **Art Magick** (DKMU & others)
- **POP MAGIC!** (Grant Morrison)
